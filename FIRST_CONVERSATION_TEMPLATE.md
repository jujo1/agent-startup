## 📋 Template (Copy Everything Below)

```
Hi Claude! I need to set up AGENTS 4.0 from the web interface using the 3 required steps:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 1: CLONE STARTUP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Repository: https://github.com/jujo1/agent-startup

Please confirm you can access these key files:
- AGENTS_3.md (workflow specification)
- CLAUDE_2.md (infrastructure details)
- SCHEMAS.md (data structures)
- WEB_AGENTS_SETUP.md (web agent guide)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 2: ESTABLISH FUNNEL CONNECTION TO CABIN-PC
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TAILSCALE FUNNEL CONNECTION:
- Gateway URL: https://cabin-pc.tail1a496.ts.net
- MCP Endpoint: https://cabin-pc.tail1a496.ts.net/sse
- Auth Token: D8V6nXegr2P1fd9PfLHNiVbLBCyG1N6jR0vTfI18b_k
- Network: Tailscale (tail1a496.ts.net)
- Target Node: cabin-pc (100.121.56.65)

Please establish a secure tunnel to cabin-pc via this funnel connection.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 3: CONNECT MPC-GATEWAY MCP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Please connect to the MPC-Gateway MCP server and test these tools:
1. ping - Test connectivity
2. get_status - Check gateway status
3. list_nodes - Show available nodes (cabin-pc, office-pc, homeassistant)
4. read_file - Read ~/.claude/AGENTS_3.md from cabin-pc

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
VERIFICATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After completing all 3 steps, please confirm:
✓ Repository access verified (Step 1)
✓ Funnel connection established (Step 2)
✓ MPC-Gateway MCP connected (Step 3)
✓ All tools working (ping, get_status, read_file, remote_exec)
✓ AGENTS_3.md loaded from cabin-pc
✓ Ready to execute workflows

Then say: "✅ All 3 steps complete. AGENTS 4.0 ready for workflows."
```

---

## 🎯 What This Does

When you paste this into Claude.ai, Claude will:

1. **Connect to MPC-Gateway** - Establishes secure connection to cabin-pc
2. **Test Tools** - Verifies all MPC-Gateway tools work
3. **Read Instructions** - Loads AGENTS_3.md, CLAUDE_2.md, SCHEMAS.md
4. **Verify Environment** - Checks workflow directory, MCP servers
5. **Confirm Ready** - Reports setup complete

---

## 📝 Expected Response

Claude should respond with something like:

```
I've successfully connected to your cabin-pc infrastructure via MPC-Gateway!

✅ Connection Status:
- Gateway: https://cabin-pc.tail1a496.ts.net ✓
- Ping: SUCCESS (response in 45ms)
- Status: All nodes online
- Available nodes: cabin-pc, office-pc, homeassistant

✅ Files Loaded:
- AGENTS_3.md (37KB) - Workflow specification
- CLAUDE_2.md (9.9KB) - Infrastructure config
- SCHEMAS.md (5.2KB) - Data structures

✅ Environment Verified:
- Workflow directory: ~/.workflow/ exists
- MCP servers: workflow-validator, todo detected
- Permissions: Read/write access confirmed

✅ Workflow Understanding:
I understand the 12-stage workflow:
STARTUP → PLAN → CRITERIA → REVIEW_PRE → DEBATE → 
IMPLEMENT → UNITTEST → SCOPEDINT → FULLINT → 
REVIEW_POST → VALIDATE → LEARN

AGENTS 4.0 web setup complete and ready for workflows.

What would you like to build?
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Setup

Once Claude confirms setup is complete, try:

### Example 1: Simple Task
```
Create a Python calculator with add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions.
Follow the complete AGENTS 4.0 workflow from STARTUP through LEARN.
```

### Example 2: Check Workflow Status
```
Show me the current workflow state from cabin-pc.
List all files in ~/.workflow/ and show the most recent workflow.
```

### Example 3: Review Evidence
```
Read the evidence logs from the last workflow execution.
Show me what stages completed and what the quality scores were.
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Connection Fails

Claude might say:
```
I cannot connect to the MPC-Gateway. Let me help troubleshoot...
```

**Your Response**:
```
Please try these steps:
1. Use the ping tool with no parameters
2. Check if the gateway URL is correct
3. Verify the auth token
4. Try get_status to see detailed error

If still failing, cabin-pc might be offline. Please confirm error message.
```

### If Files Not Found

Claude might say:
```
I cannot read AGENTS_3.md from ~/.claude/
```

**Your Response**:
```
Please use remote_exec to check if the file exists:

Command: ls -la ~/.claude/AGENTS_3.md

If file doesn't exist, we need to run the setup.sh script first.
```

### If MCP Servers Not Responding

Claude might say:
```
workflow-validator MCP server is not responding
```

**Your Response**:
```
Please check if MCP servers are running:

Use remote_exec with command: ps aux | grep workflow_validator

If not running, start them with:
python ~/.claude/mcp/servers/workflow_validator.py
```

---

## 📚 Advanced Setup (Optional)

After basic setup works, you can configure:

### A. Enable Memory Systems

```
Please verify memory systems are configured:

1. Check ~/.claude/shared-memory/ exists
2. Read ~/.claude/settings.json for memory MCP config
3. Test memory read/write via remote_mcp
```

### B. Configure Third-Party Validation

```
Please set up OpenAI MCP for third-party validation:

1. Check if openai-chat MCP server is configured
2. Verify API key is set
3. Test with a simple chat completion
```

### C. Enable Parallel Execution

```
Please verify parallel execution capability:

1. Check office-pc is accessible via remote_exec
2. Test spawning multiple agents
3. Verify observer monitoring is configured
```

## 📞 Need Help?

If this template doesn't work:

1. **Check Prerequisites**:
   - Is cabin-pc online?
   - Is MPC-Gateway running?
   - Is token correct?

2. **Manual Verification**:
   - Try each MPC-Gateway tool individually
   - Start with `ping`, then `get_status`
   - Progress to `read_file` and `remote_exec`

3. **Review Documentation**:
   - WEB_AGENTS_SETUP.md (detailed guide)
   - CLAUDE_2.md (infrastructure details)
   - MCP_SETUP.md (MCP server setup)
